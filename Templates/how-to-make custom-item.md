For example in order to change a diamond axe you would write a .properties file similar to


```properties
type=item
items=minecraft:diamond_axe
texture=diamond_battleaxe
nbt.display.Name=battleaxe
```
You would then have your desired texture as .png in the same folder with the name diamond_battleaxe.png

Basically you'll create a .properties file located in sgcraftpack/assets/minecraft/optifine/cit
